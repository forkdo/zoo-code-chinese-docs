# Using Kenari With Zoo Code

Zoo Code supports accessing models through [Kenari](https://kenari.id), an Indonesian OpenAI-compatible AI gateway billed in Rupiah (IDR). One `kn-` API key reaches Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi and more over a single endpoint.

**Website:** [https://kenari.id](https://kenari.id)

## Getting an API Key

1.  **Sign Up/Sign In:** Go to [kenari.id](https://kenari.id) and create an account or sign in.
2.  **Create a Key:** Open **API keys** in the dashboard and click **Create key**. The key is prefixed `kn-` and is shown only once, so copy it right away. One key works for every model.

---

## Available Models

Zoo Code automatically fetches the available models from Kenari's public `/v1/models` endpoint, so the list stays current with no extension update.

Prices are listed in Rupiah in the [Kenari catalog](https://kenari.id/docs) rather than inside Zoo Code, because Kenari bills in IDR while the extension shows prices in USD.

---

## Configuration in Zoo Code

1.  **Open Zoo Code Settings:** Click the gear icon (<Codicon name="gear" />) in the Zoo Code panel.
2.  **Select Provider:** Choose "Kenari" from the "API Provider" dropdown.
3.  **Enter API Key:** Paste your `kn-` key into the "Kenari API Key" field.
4.  **Select Model:** Choose your desired model from the "Model" dropdown.

## Tips and Notes

- **One key, many models:** A single `kn-` key reaches Claude, GPT, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi and others through the same endpoint.
- **Rupiah billing:** Usage is metered and billed in Indonesian Rupiah, with no foreign card required.
- **OpenAI and Anthropic compatible:** Kenari serves both the OpenAI `/chat/completions` and Anthropic `/messages` shapes, so existing tooling works unchanged.
